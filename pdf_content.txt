 1. Brief Explanation on the Proposed Application  
1.1 Clarity and Conciseness  
As discussed in  assignment 1, the proposed application is the Predictive Employee 
Retention System (PERS). The purpose of PERS is to serve as an early warning system that 
helps address the costly and disruptive problem of unexpected employee attrition. Its main 
purpose is to help Human Resources ( HR) keep valuable employees by predicting what factors 
might make them leave and identifying those who are at high risk of resigning before they 
resign , maintaining or improving employee retention.  
The system works by combining Machine Learning (ML) with a Collective Intelligence 
(CI) approach. It uses supervised learning trained on the organization’s combined workforce 
data such as Human Resources Information System ( HRIS ) records, performance scores, and 
employee engagement results.  It starts with a data pre -processing engine that cleans and 
organizes this raw data. The clean data is then fed into the ML prediction model, which 
analyses it and produces an attrition risk score for each employee. To ensure high accuracy and 
stable performance, the system relies on powerful ensemble models like Random Forest (RF) 
and Extra Trees Classifier (ETC) . The PERS application serves as the user interface, showing 
the results and highlighting employees who are at high risk of leaving. This helps the HR team 
understand the reasons behind the risks and make better decisions to retain staff.  
1.2 Relevance and Scope  
The main goal of PERS is to turn raw organi sational data into useful predictions that 
assist in  smarter decision -making for Human Resource Management (HRM). The system 
continuously collects and analyses  internal workforce data  such as HRIS information, 
employee engagement levels, and performance records.  It aims to shift HR departments away 
from reactive  and subjective decision -making to more proactive strategies guided by patterns 
observed across the entire workforce.  
To achieve this, the system uses ensemble machine learning methods that will capture 
the organi sation’s collective behaviour data and convert it into reliable predictions. The Extra 
Trees Classifier (ETC) is selected specifically because research shows it can achieve high 
accuracy  making it highly dependable in identifying whether an employee is “High -Risk” , 
“Medium -Risk”, and  “Low -Risk.”  
PERS is designed to directly tackle employee attrition, a major issue that leads to long -
term financial loss when experienced or essential employees leave. By compiling historical 
data from the entire workforce to train its predictive models, the system forms a shared 
organizational knowledge base that is far more reliable and actionable than relying on 
individual managerial intuition. This approach reflects the growing shift toward data -driven

 HR practices. PERS essentially digiti ses the organi sation’s collective intelligence on employee 
satisfaction and behaviour  patterns, giving HR teams the tools they need to identify potential 
risks early and make informed decisions based on evidence rather than assumptions.  
1.3 Context and Justification  
The application is highly relevant because employees are one of an organization’s most 
valuable assets, crucial for its reputation and long -term success. Failing to maintain a stable 
workforce can result in significant long -term losses. A study reveals that Malaysia’s voluntary 
turnover rate has reached 9.5%, one of the highest in Southeast Asia, highlighting the country’s 
growing challenge in retaining talent (Sim, 2024) . Traditional methods of managing attrition, 
which rely on subjective interpretations, are often inefficient and fail to prevent employee 
departures. PERS addresses this gap by enabling HR decisions to be based on objective, 
predictive data analysis . 
One key user benefit  of this application is its ability to enable targeted early 
interventions. PERS gives  HR to take timely actions  such as offering flexible schedules, 
adjusting workloads, or providing career development opportunities  before an employee 
decides to resign.  The application also enhances transparency and communication. By 
identifying the specific factors that place an employee at high risk of attrition, PERS promotes 
fairness, clearer communication, and a better understanding between HR and managerial staff 
when designing retention strategies.   
Additionally, the system provides objective decision support. HR teams can base 
critical retention decisions on data -driven insights derived from employees’ historical records, 
consistently outperforming decisions made solely through manual judgment or int uition.   
Finally, PERS continuously improves over time. It is designed with a learning loop that 
updates the predictive models as HR inputs feedback on interventions or actual reasons for 
resignations. This allows the system to adapt to changing organizational cond itions, ensuring 
that its predictions remain accurate and relevant.  
2. Pipeline of the Proposed Application  
2.1 Comprehensive Stages  
2.1.1 Data Collection  
Employee data is collected from HRIS , including  attendance records, 
performance evaluations, engagement metrics, and demo graphic records. This may 
include  details such as the  number of previous companies worked  at, monthly  income, 
job satisfaction, job role, department, job level, and total working hour s. All these inputs 
are integrated and merged into a single, structured  dataset for further  processing.  

=== PAGE 5 ===
5 
 2.1.2 Data Preprocessing  
Data preprocessing must be carried out to prepare the dataset for modelling and includes 
the following tasks:  
a. Data Cleaning  
Values that are missing, duplicated, or outliers are removed and repaired  to ensure 
data reliability . 
b. Normalisation and Standardisation  
Numerical features are scaled to consistent ranges so the model can process them 
effectively.  
c. Encoding Categorical Variables  
Fields such as gender, job role, or department are converted into numeric form 
using techniques such as one -hot encoding or label encoding.  
d. Feature Selection  
Using correlation analysis  and variance thresholds , low-impact or irrelevant 
predictors are removed to ensure the accuracy of prediction.  
e. Train -Test Split:  
Dataset is split for example, 70% for training and 30% for testing to ensure  proper  
model evaluation and validation . 
2.1.3 Model Training  
The cleaned and transformed dataset is used to train the predictive model.  
Ensemble ML methods such as RF and ETC are applied during this s tage, where the 
models learn patterns associated with employee attrition.  
2.1.4 Model Evaluation  
The best -performing ML model is selected for deployment based on their 
performance assessed using the previously separated test set. The key evaluation includes 
accuracy, precision and recall, F1 -score, and Receiver Operating Characteristic – Area 
Under the Curve (ROC -AUC).  
2.1.5 Prediction and Risk Scoring  
The final model generates an attrition risk score  for every employee  based on the 
processed input data . The system classifies the employees into categories such as “High-
risk”, “Medium -risk” and “Low-risk” to indicate their likelihood of resigning.  These 
results are produced in real time whenever new or updated employee data is fed into the 
system , giving HR continuous, up -to-date insights into workforce retention levels.  
  

=== PAGE 6 ===

 2.1.6 CI-Based Knowledge Integration  
This stage integrates the ML predictions with inputs from the organisation’s CI. 
It combines HR feedback, such as reasons of resignation and the outcomes of retention 
interventions, as well as insights from managers. Organisational knowledge, such as 
polic ies, workload trends, and promotion cycles is also considered. Combing these 
sources of information helps to refine model’s predictions.  
2.1.7 Decision Support and Intervention Planning  
The PERS interface presents insights t o HR such as list of high -risk employees, 
contributing factors to attrition, and the recommended retention strategies.  
2.1.8 Continuous Learning Feedback Loop  
The PERS collects feedback as HR implements the early intervention to prevent 
attrition  and constantly updates the system. These updates are used to retrain the model 
and to refresh feature importance, ensuring PERS stays accurate and relevant over time.  
2.2 Logical Flow  
The pipeline follows a structured and sequential flow to ensure accurate employee attrition 
prediction. First, the system collects raw employee information from HRIS sources and 
consolidates it into a unified dataset . This dataset then flows into the preprocessing stage, where it 
is systematically transformed into a machine -readable form. Once prepared, the processed data 
moves into model training, where the machine learning algorithms learn the underlying attrition 
patterns.  
The trained models are then evaluated to determine which performs best, and the selected 
model is used for generating attrition risk predictions. These predictions are enriched through 
organisational knowledge integration, where HR insights, managerial feedback, and contextual 
company information add greater depth to the results. The refined insights then progress into the 
decision -support stage, allowing HR to plan targeted retention strategies.  
Finally, the outcomes of HR inter ventions loop back into the system through a continuous 
learning mechanism, enabling the model to be retrained and updated over time. This creates a 
closed, adaptive pipeline where every stage depends on the previous one, and feedback continually 
enhances future predictions.

 2.3 Task Descriptions  
Table 1 – Task Descriptions of each Pipeline Stages . 
Pipeline Stage  Task Description  
Data Collection  Employee data is gathered from HRIS sources such as attendance 
logs, s alary records, demographic details, performance ratings, and 
engagement survey results. This stage ensures the machine 
learning model has sufficient organizational  knowledge to identify 
attrition behavior .  
Data Preprocessing  The collected data is cleaned, structured, and transformed so it is 
ready for Machine Learning. Techniques include  missing value 
treatment, duplication removal, feature scaling, and categorical 
encoding. A Train -Test Split prepares data for fair model 
evaluation.  
Model Training  Ensemble ML algorithms such as Random Forest (RF) and Extra 
Trees Classifier (ETC) are trained to study historical patterns 
associated with employees who stay versus those who leave, 
enabling accurate risk learning.  
Model Evaluation  Each trained model is assessed using standard evaluation metrics 
such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 -score, and ROC -AUC. The 
top-performing model is selected for deployment to ensure 
dependable prediction  output.  
Prediction & Risk 
Scoring  The selected model automatically generates real -time attrition risk 
scores and classifies employees into High/Medium/Low attrition 
risk groups. These predications help HR teams prioritize 
intervention efforts effectively.  
CI-Based Knowledge 
Integration  Model predictions are cross validated with collective intelligence 
inputs such as HR insights, resignation feedback records, and 
managerial assessments. This combination offers richer contex t 
and increases the reliability of prediction -based decisions.  
  

=== PAGE 8 ===

 Decision Support & 
Intervention Planning  The system presents interpretable findings through the PERS 
interface, such as key drivers influencing attrition and suggested 
preventive actions, helping HR teams plan and apply tailored 
retention measures.  
Continuous Learning 
Feedback Loop  As HR implements interventions and records new outcomes, 
updated data is fed back into the model. Retraining ensures that the 
system continually adapts to organizationa l changes, improving 
prediction accuracy over time.  
 
2.4 Inter -stage Dependencies  
Every stage in the PERS pipeline is connected through a strict sequence in which the 
output of one stage becomes the direct input for the next.  
Firstly, the data preprocessing stage is dependent on the output from data collection 
stage. The cleaning, normalisation, and encoding task cannot begin until diverse data points, 
such as HRIS records and engagement surveys are aggregated into the single, raw dataset 
produced in the first stage.  
Next, the model training stage depends on the clean, well -structured data produced 
during the data preprocessing stage. Machine learning algorithms require properly encoded 
inputs and cannot work with missing or inconsistent values. High -quality preprocess ing is 
essential, as the model’s performance and accuracy are directly tied to the completeness and 
reliability of previous stage.  
Following model training, the evaluation stage relies on the trained models and the 
predefined test set to measure predictive quality. Only after evaluation and identification the 
best-performing model can risk scoring occur.  
The prediction and risk -scoring stage relies entirely on the trained model produced 
during the model training stage. The system employs the patterns, relationships, and 
mathematical rules the model has learned from historical data to estimate the likelihoo d of risk 
for current employees. Without this trained model, the system would have no basis for 
interpreting new inputs or generating meaningful probability scores. These predictions then 
feed directly into the CI -based integration stage, which enriches th e model’s output using HR 
feedback, managerial insights, and organisational knowledge.  
  

=== PAGE 9 ===

 Then, the decision -support stage depends on the outputs of prediction and CI 
integration. The HR dashboard needs the risk scores and enriched insights to highlight high -
risk employees with the explanation of the contributing factors. This will guide HR in planning 
targeted interventions.  
Lastly, the continuous learning stage depends on the HR feedback and the intervention 
outcomes recorded during the decision support stage. This new data regarding whether and 
employee stayed or left serves as the necessary input to trigger the retraining c ycle. This allows 
the system to adapt to new trends.   
2.5 Flexibility and Adaptability  
The PERS pipeline is design ed to  remain flexible and adaptive  system as organisational 
conditions, workforce behaviours, and data environments evolve . The modular data 
architecture  of the pipeline allows new information sources  to be integrated smoothly . For 
instance, if the organisation can introduce  new data sources, such as remote work frequency, or 
new engagement metrics without requiring a complete system redesign.  This is because the pre -
processing engine can be updated to encode these features seamle ssly. The selected algorithm 
enhances this adaptability, since  its computational efficiency enables frequent  and fast 
retraining cycles even as the dataset grows . This allows the system to scale  seamlessly with the 
organisation’s growth  and operational complexity . 
Furthermore,  the adaptability of the system is achieved through a continuous learning 
feedback loop, where the outcomes of HR interventions and actual employee departures will 
be used to improve the application. This new data triggers periodic retraining of the model, 
enabling it  to learn new attrition patter ns. For instance, new attrition patterns that are caused by 
economic changes and workplace dynamic shifts . Through this mechanism, the pipeline 
continually updates its decision logic and preserves relev ance over time  without manual 
reconfiguration .
